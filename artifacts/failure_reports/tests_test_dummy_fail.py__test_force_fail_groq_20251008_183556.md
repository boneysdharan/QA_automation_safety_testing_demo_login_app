# 🧪 Failure Report: tests/test_dummy_fail.py::test_force_fail_groq
**Layer:** Cloud AI Tests  
**Timestamp:** 20251008_183556
## ❌ Error Message
## ☁️ Groq Analysis (Cloud)
**Likely Cause:**
The test `test_force_fail_groq` is intentionally designed to fail. The assertion `assert 1 == 2` is expected to fail because 1 is not equal to 2.

**Quick Fix:**
Since this is an intentional failure, there is no need to fix the test. However, if you want to make the test pass, you can modify the assertion to `assert 1 == 1`, which is always true.

**Alternative Solution:**
If you want to keep the test as an intentional failure, you can modify the test to use a different assertion that will fail, such as `assert 1 == 3`. This will ensure that the test continues to fail as intended.

**Example Code:**
```python
def test_force_fail_groq():
    """Intentional failure to test Groq+Ollama analyzer integration."""
    assert 1 == 3, "Intentional failure to test analyzer"
```
This code will continue to fail as intended, and you can use it to test the behavior of your code when an assertion fails.
