# 🧪 Failure Report: tests/test_dummy_fail.py::test_force_fail_ollama
**Layer:** Local AI Tests  
**Timestamp:** 20251008_183430
## ❌ Error Message
## ☁️ Groq Analysis (Cloud)
**Likely Cause:**
The test `test_force_fail_ollama` is intentionally designed to fail. The assertion `assert 1 == 2` is expected to fail because 1 is not equal to 2. This test is likely used to test the error handling or logging mechanisms of the Groq+Ollama analyzer integration.

**Quick Fix:**
Since this test is intentionally designed to fail, there is no need to fix it. However, if you want to modify it to pass, you can change the assertion to:

```python
assert 1 == 1, "Intentional failure to test analyzer"
```

Or, if you want to keep the original intention of the test, you can modify it to test the error handling or logging mechanisms:

```python
try:
    assert 1 == 2, "Intentional failure to test analyzer"
except AssertionError as e:
    # Test that the error is logged or handled correctly
    assert "Intentional failure to test analyzer" in str(e)
```

**Recommendation:**
If you're using this test to test the error handling or logging mechanisms, consider renaming it to something more descriptive, such as `test_analyzer_error_handling`. This will make it clearer what the test is intended to test.
